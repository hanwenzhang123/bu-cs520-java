Scalar vs Multilvalue Variable Types
- the vriables types we have seen so far (int , String, Employee, etc) and store one value at one time
- these are called scalar variables and fit their purpose well
- hoewver, we also need data structures
 

Arrays 
- an array is a single varibales that can hold multiple values
- an java class can be defined as an array, but the array can only instances of the defined class
- denoted by square brackets: []
- upon createion, arrays hold

Creating arrays
int[] myArray = new int[5]    //the size of array has to be declared first
the left of the [] always empty, just for it is for array

Array is not empty, always have somthing, including null

Array member values & assignmnet
- the square brackets are also used to access a specific member of the array; this number is called the index(also called the position)
- remember to start counting with zero
- array values can be written as well as read
- if the index is smaller or larger than the size of the array, java will throw an ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException exception

Initializing arrays at creation time
- arrays can be populated when they are created using this syntax
int [] myArray = {7, 8, 24, 45, 90} 
- these are sam types of arrays as 
- can not change the types at all\
