The Set data structure is used to represent a collection of values without any duplicate elements. The Set data structure is used to represent a collection of values without any duplicate elements. 
  
HashSet: Elements are stored in a hash table for fast implementation. There is no guarantee as to the order of the elements in the set.
TreeSet: Elements are stored internally in a tree data structure, which guarantees logarithmic access time for addition, removal and retrieval of elements. The elements in the set are ordered based on their values.
LinkedHashSet: Elements are stored in a hash table with a linked list. The elements are ordered based on the order in which they are inserted.
