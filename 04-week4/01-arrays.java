Java provides a data type called an array that allows us to define a single variable that has multiple values of the same type. 
  These values, called elements, may be accessed through an index value that represents the position of the element within the array. 
  Thus, the elements are also called indexed variables.

To define an array variable, we need:
- The type of the elements, called the base type
- The name of the array (any legal identifier)
- The number of elements in the array, called the size or length of the array, which could be any expression that evaluates to a non-negative integer value.
  
//Declaring and Creating Arrays
Array variables are declared using square brackets: [ ].
// Declare an array of integer values
int[] salaries;
