String
- a string is a series of characters within double quote marks "string"
- strings can contain any characters you can type (and ones you can not)
- a string is not a primitive, it is class, java.lang.String
- "" - empty string, perfectly valid
- start counting from 0, space counts

Things to do with strings
- non-destructive mthods: they will not change the original string

str = str.replace('a', 'x');  //you have to save in order to replace the value
.startsWith("") //always true
.endsWith("") //always true
.substring(0) //always print the whole thing

Comparing strings with compareTo()  //integer 0 - equal, non-0 - non-equal
- string has a compareTo() method:
  String string1 = "abc";
  String string2 = "def";
  String string3 = "ghi";
  String string3 = "ghi";
  int result = String3.compareTo(string4); //0
  result = String3.compareTo(string2); //3
  
A result of zero means the strings are equal

Comparing strings with equals()
- never compare strings with ==    //it is good for primitives, but not for objects
- compares object references, not raw values (excepts primitives)
- == works for primitives because they are raw values
- use equals() or equalsIgnoreCase()

Parsing strings
- parsing is a way of reading and interpreting values
- the classes behind all primitive types hav e static parsing method
  Integer.parseInt("34"); //34
  Double.parseDouble("34.5"); //34.5
- these parsers will fail if the strings are not convertible
  
Creating strings
- strings are immutable (they cannot change)
- but we can treat them as if they are mutable
  String x = "abc";
  x = "abc123";  //A new string behind the scenes
  //like throw out the old thing to the garbage collection and store the new thing
  //however the type can not be changed since String are immutable
- Strings can be concatenated (combined) using +
- java.lang.String has a static method called valueOf() that accepts any type of primitive:
  String.valueOf(123) //"123"

Q:
how to re-assign string value in java?
String x = "abc";
  x = "abc123";  //A new string behind the scenes
What if I want to reassign the value in x?
A:
yes, you can and that's what we mean by whatever it was pointing to is now marked for garbage collection if there are no more references to it
so in the above, you are doing exactly that x is initially pointing at the memory location that contains the string "abc"
you then reassign it to a new memory location where the new string "abc123" is found
but because x is of type String what it points to can't be changed, because Strings are immutable

String math
- string are concatenated using the same symbol by which number are added : +
- java read from left to right to perform concatenation - as soon as a string is encountered, everything after it will be treated as a string
  String x = "abc"+123; //abc123
- but since it reads from left to right, if numbers precede strings, the mathematical addition operation will be carried out
  String x = 123+456+"abc"; //579abc
  
StringBuffer
- manipulating many strings can be computationally inefficient
- the StringBuffer class offers a more efficient means of dealing with strings and introduces some added functionality
  StringBuffer sb = new StringBuffer();
  sb.append("abc")  //abc
  sb.append("ghi")  //abcghi
  sb.insert(3, "def");   //abcdefghi //put in the position 3
  sb.delete(2, 4);  //abefghi //delete from position 2 to 4, position 2 and 3

Regular Expressions
- look for patterns in the strings in each language
java support for regex is in java.util.regex

Working with files (I/O)
- java has built-in support for file input/output in the java.io package
- java I/O uses reader, writers and streams to move data to and from files
- data to be read to/written from files can be textual (ASCII)(text file) or binary
- file systems are complex and OS-specific, but the JVM's native interface does the dirty work
- exception handling is critical when working with files, becuase so many thing can go wrong
- files must be opened/closed properly

The File class
- java.io.File provide many handy methods to manipulate files:
  File file = new File("file.txt");
  file.exists()
  file.length()
  file.isHidden();
  file.delete();
  
Streams - when start reading from or writing a file
- streams are like tunnels for data in and out of files
- streams are also used in other context (networking)
- java.io has many types of streams for different uses
- a very simple input stream class is FileInputStream;
  FileInputStream file = new FileInputStream("file.txt"); //read input from a file
- with this stream created, it can then be fed into a reader or writer

Reading ASCII(text) files
- Use the same Scanner class that we have used for console input 

  FileInputStream stream = new FileInputStream("file.txt");
  Scanner scanner = new Scanner(stream); //pass the stream to the scanner
  //read lines from file one at a time until the end
  while(scanner.hasNextLine()) {  //reading line by line until reaches the last one
    String line = scanner.nextLine(); //like overloaded
    }
    
This also works:
  Scanner scanner = new Scanner(new File("file.txt"));

Writing ASCII (txt) files
- FileOutputStream is a stream type that can send text to a file
  FileOutputStream stream = new FileOutputStream("file.txt");
- FileWriter is most commonly used writer for files
  Writer writer = new FileWriter(stream);
  writer.write("here is some text")   //using the method .write()
- PrintWriter can also write to files using the familiar println() method
  PrintWriter writer = new PrintWriter(stream);
  writer.println("here is some text")   //using a different package
- This also works:
  PrintWriter writer = new PrintWriter("file.txt");

Closing files
- files should always be closed to avoid leaving them in an open state
- for write operations, the stream and the writer can be closed:
  FileOutputStream stream = new FileOutputStream("file.txt");
  PrintWriter writer = new PrintWriter(stream);
  writer.println("here is some text");
  stream.close();
  writer.close();
