method in java

objects: state and behavior
state - attributes
behavior - a set of methods

example: pen
state: green
behavior: writing

What is OOP?
classes are like blueprints for objects that serve a specific purpose
classes are brought to life as object instances
classes have attributes and methods
methods are invoked by other classes and methods

constructors
constructors create instances of classes
every class has a constructor 
constructor name must match that of the class

a class can be instantiated using the new keyword: 
  Employee employee = new Employee();  //calling that specific constructor
using new causes the target c;ass constructor to run
java will automatically find the right constructor
