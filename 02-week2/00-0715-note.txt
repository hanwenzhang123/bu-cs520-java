Packages
- java classes that share a common purpose are usually grouped together into packages
- name convention involves "reverse domain name notation"

Inheritance
- a subclass(child) inherits from its superclass(parent)
- subclasses are often called derived classes
- subclass can do everything its superclass can do
- a subclass can add new functionality that does not exist in the superclass, this is called extending the superclass
- java only supports single inheritance!!!
